I'm a product architect and full-stack developer living in Seoul, Korea.

Recently I focus on what it takes to make simple and reliable web applications, how to combine various devops technologies.

I love many simple and creative open source softwares that change the way we live and believe that they will make more people do much more useful things and change this world flourishing.
