Full changelog:   
  
--[ Redis 3.0.3 ] Release date: 17 Jul 2015   
   
Upgrade urgency: LOW for Redis and Sentinel.   
  
* [FIX] Fix blocking operations timeout precision when HZ is at its default 
        value (not increased) and there are thousands of clients connected 
        at the same time. This bug affected Sidekiq users that experienced 
        a very long delay for BLPOP and similar commands to return for 
        timeout. Check commit b029ff1 for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo) 
* [FIX] MIGRATE "creating socket: Invalid argument" error fix. Check 
        issues #2609 and #2612 for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo) 
* [FIX] Be able to connect to the master even when the slave is bound to 
        just the loopback interface and has no valid public address in the 
        network the master is reacahble. (Salvatore Sanfilippo) 
* [FIX] ZADD with options encoding promotion fixed. (linfangrong) 
* [FIX] Reset aof_delayed_fsync on CONFIG RESETSTATS. (Tom Kiemes) 
* [FIX] PFCOUNT key parsing in cluster fixed. (MOON_CLJ) 
* [FIX] Fix Solaris compilation of Redis 3.0. (Jan-Erik Rediger)   

* [NEW] Variadic EXISTS command. Now the command accepts multiple arguments  
        and returns the total count of existing keys.
